# Kamo2

forked from [kamo](https://github.com/jihoo12/kamo)

An experimental Cartesian cubical proof-assistant kernel in Rust. It uses safe
indexed arenas and explicit S-expressions. There are no postulates, recursive
definitions, or special evaluator cases for a library function named `ua`.

`examples/univalence.kamo` contains **checked definitions** of equivalences,
`ua`, identity and Boolean-negation equivalences, and the full `univalence`
theorem: the canonical map from universe paths to equivalences is an equivalence.
The implementation is a new kernel, not a formally verified or independently
audited implementation of the metatheory.

## Run

```sh
cargo build --release
scripts/with-limits.sh target/release/kamo check examples/univalence.kamo
scripts/with-limits.sh target/release/kamo normalize examples/univalence.kamo neg-true
# false
scripts/with-limits.sh target/release/kamo normalize examples/univalence.kamo neg-false
# true
scripts/with-limits.sh target/release/kamo normalize examples/univalence.kamo neg-inverse
# false
scripts/with-limits.sh target/release/kamo normalize examples/univalence.kamo neg-twice
# true
```

`--stats` on `normalize` reports evaluator work, arena allocations, and retained
arena capacity. `--reference` disables interning, reduction caches, and the
optimized collapsing of substitution suspensions. Both modes use the same
mathematical reduction rules; this is a differential implementation check, not
an independent proof of correctness.

## A first proof: natural-number addition

[`examples/nat-add.kamo`](examples/nat-add.kamo) is a standalone introduction to
dependent elimination and paths. It defines addition using `nat-elim` on the
first argument, then proves both zero identities. `zero + n = n` follows by
computation; `n + zero = n` is proved by induction. The successor step maps `suc`
over the induction hypothesis with `(path i (suc (at ih i)))`.

```sh
scripts/with-limits.sh target/release/kamo check examples/nat-add.kamo
scripts/with-limits.sh target/release/kamo normalize examples/nat-add.kamo four
# (suc (suc (suc (suc zero))))
scripts/with-limits.sh target/release/kamo normalize examples/nat-add.kamo two-plus-zero-proof
# (path i0 (suc (suc zero)))
```

The type of `add-zero-right` states the theorem for every natural number;
`two-plus-zero-proof` specializes it to two. `proof-left` and `proof-right`
evaluate its endpoints, both yielding `(suc (suc zero))`.

## Foundations for Yoneda

[`examples/foundations.kamo`](examples/foundations.kamo) supplies checked `U 0`
definitions of `refl`, `sym`, `concat`, `cong`, dependent congruence, dependent
function extensionality (`funext`) and its pointwise inverse (`happly`). It also
defines `isProp` and `isSet`, proves `isProp-to-isSet`, and proves closure of
propositions and sets under dependent functions (`isPropPi`, `isSetPi`).

```sh
scripts/with-limits.sh target/release/kamo check examples/foundations.kamo
```

Here a proposition has a path between any two inhabitants; a set has a
propositional path type between each pair of inhabitants. No global proof
irrelevance or sethood of arbitrary types is assumed. These are foundations
for the planned set-valued Yoneda lemma; the lemma itself is not yet implemented.
The file is
standalone; clients can append further declarations to its source before
checking. Kernel tests check both function-extensionality round trips for
arbitrary dependent families in both execution modes.

[`examples/category.kamo`](examples/category.kamo) builds on these foundations
with small categories, a constructor requiring all category laws, and named
projections. Hom types must be sets; object types need not be sets. Examples
include an indiscrete category on two objects and a general construction of
the category of functions between an indexed family of small sets.

```sh
cat examples/foundations.kamo examples/category.kamo > /tmp/kamo-category.kamo
scripts/with-limits.sh target/release/kamo check /tmp/kamo-category.kamo
scripts/with-limits.sh target/release/kamo normalize /tmp/kamo-category.kamo example-result
# true
```

The files are concatenated in dependency order; Kamo has no import syntax.
See [category library notes](docs/categories.md) for composition order, the
record layout, universe levels, and the next steps toward Yoneda.

[`examples/functor.kamo`](examples/functor.kamo) adds small-set-valued covariant
functors with explicit set proofs and pointwise identity/composition laws.
It includes the representable functor `C(r, -)`, constant functors, and the
underlying-set functor for an indexed category of functions.

```sh
cat examples/foundations.kamo examples/category.kamo examples/functor.kamo > /tmp/kamo-functor.kamo
scripts/with-limits.sh target/release/kamo check /tmp/kamo-functor.kamo
scripts/with-limits.sh target/release/kamo normalize /tmp/kamo-functor.kamo representable-result
# true
```

[`examples/natural.kamo`](examples/natural.kamo) defines natural transformations,
their identity and vertical composition, and `nat-ext`: pointwise equality of
components gives equality of the entire transformation, including its naturality
proof. It also proves the unit and associativity laws for vertical composition.
The foundations file supplies the supporting `prop-family-path` and
`sigma-path-prop` lemmas.

```sh
cat examples/foundations.kamo examples/category.kamo examples/functor.kamo examples/natural.kamo > /tmp/kamo-natural.kamo
scripts/with-limits.sh target/release/kamo check /tmp/kamo-natural.kamo
scripts/with-limits.sh target/release/kamo normalize /tmp/kamo-natural.kamo natural-result
# true
# Reference evaluation needs a larger node budget for this library.
scripts/with-limits.sh target/release/kamo check /tmp/kamo-natural.kamo --reference --max-nodes 1000000
```

## Resource limits

The development runner imposes a **512 MiB virtual-address-space limit** and a
30-second timeout on the child process. These are Linux/Bash process limits,
independent of the checker. It requires `timeout` from GNU coreutils.

The library and CLI additionally enforce:

- 4 MiB input limit and 512 levels of source-expression nesting.
- By default, 1,000,000 evaluation/checking steps and 250,000 arena nodes per
  declaration or normalization, configurable with `--fuel` and `--max-nodes`.
- Bounded face-solver depth, intermediate expansion, clause size, and caching.
- A fresh semantic arena for each checked declaration, discarded immediately
  afterwards. Normalization also uses its own arena.

A resource error is an **inconclusive check**, never a successful proof or a
judgment that a mathematical statement is false. Node limits are work/storage
guards, not a hard byte limit; use the runner for a hard process limit. Syntax
is retained for the lifetime of a checked program. Arena statistics exclude
hash maps, transient solver allocations, allocator metadata, and stack space;
use OS peak RSS measurements for total process memory.

## Language

Definitions are ordered and explicit: `(def name type body)`. Later definitions
can refer to earlier ones. `;` starts a line comment. Functions, pairs, and paths
are checked against an expected type; use `(ann term type)` when their type must
be inferred, for example before applying an inline lambda.

| Form | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `(U level)` | Explicit, non-cumulative universe; `U n : U (n+1)` |
| `(Pi x A B)`, `(lam x body)`, `(app f x)` | Dependent function, introduction, application |
| `(Sigma x A B)`, `(pair a b)`, `(fst p)`, `(snd p)` | Dependent pair and projections |
| `Bool`, `true`, `false` | Strict Booleans |
| `(bool-elim motive true-case false-case value)` | Dependent Boolean elimination |
| `Nat`, `zero`, `(suc n)` | Strict natural numbers |
| `(nat-elim motive zero-case step value)` | Dependent natural elimination; step takes predecessor and recursive result |
| `(Path i A left right)`, `(path i body)`, `(at p r)` | Dependent paths and interval application |
| `(coe i A r s cap)` | Transport from `r` to `s` in family `A` |
| `(com i A r s cap ((face tube) ...))` | Heterogeneous composition; each tube binds `i` |
| `(system A ((face value) ...))` | A compatible system covering the current face |
| `(Glue B ((face A equivalence) ...))` | Equivalence extension of `B` |
| `(glue G base ((face value) ...))` | Introduction with explicit Glue type `G` |
| `(unglue G value)` | Projection with explicit Glue type `G` |

Dimensions are `0`, `1`, or bound interval names. Faces are `top`, `bottom`,
`(= r s)`, `(and phi psi)`, or `(or phi psi)`. Interval variables have a separate
namespace from term variables. They are **not Boolean variables**: the faces
`i = 0` and `i = 1` do not cover an arbitrary interval.

Formation checks, tube/cap compatibility, overlaps, and endpoint equations are
mandatory. Each Glue equivalence contains a forward function and a proof that
all its homotopy fibers are contractible; providing an inverse function alone
does not suffice.

## Library API

```rust
use kamo::CheckedProgram;
let program = CheckedProgram::check("(def answer Bool true)")?;
assert_eq!(program.normalize("answer")?.text, "true");
# Ok::<(), kamo::Error>(())
```

`CheckedProgram` owns immutable checked syntax. Its constructors check all
definitions; the public API does not expose unchecked evaluator entry points or
semantic arena IDs. Results own their output strings and statistics and survive
arena disposal. `Options` exposes the work/node budgets and evaluation mode.
`benchmark_conversion` times semantic conversion without parsing, type checking,
quotation, or output in the timed section.

## Tests and benchmarks

```sh
CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=1 cargo test --no-run
scripts/with-limits.sh cargo test --lib --tests -- --test-threads=1
CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=1 cargo bench --bench kernel --no-run
scripts/with-limits.sh cargo bench --bench kernel
```

The benchmark uses five fresh evaluator sessions per case and reports median
conversion time plus arena counters. Cases cover repeated univalence transport,
transport through dependent functions and pairs, nested Glue, and open-term
conversion. See [benchmark notes](docs/benchmarks.md) for measured results and
their limitations.

The first milestone omits Agda compatibility, implicit inference, general
recursion, user-defined inductives, higher inductive types, and editor tooling.
Universe levels are explicit numbers; the checked library supplies its theorem
at `U 0` with the necessary `U 1` auxiliaries rather than universe polymorphism.
Pretty printing produces explicit normal forms with generated binder names;
some introduction forms still need annotations when reused as inference inputs.

See [rule correspondence](docs/rules.md) for the theory, evaluator, and trusted
implementation boundary.

Quotation handles successor chains iteratively and limits other structural
quotation to 64 recursive levels, returning a resource error for deeper output.
See the [kernel audit and remediation](docs/kernel-audit.md) for the conversion
and stack-exhaustion regressions.
